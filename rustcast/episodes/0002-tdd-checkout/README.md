# TDD Check out cast

Implement Checkout that gets initialised with some price list and allows to scan 
items one by one and calculates total price. 

Item   | Price 
-------+-------
Apple  | 0.40
Tomato | 0.25
Mango  | 0.25

Find a way to encode price list 

Example: 
    You scan 2 apples and 1 tomato, then total prices must be
    2 * 0.40 + 1 * 0.25 = 1.05
